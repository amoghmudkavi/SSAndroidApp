to run app on actual android phone (LG style 3+)

With Android Studio shut down...

Turn on Developer options (tap 7 times on build number in settings
(Settings>System>About Phone>Build Number
Turn on USB Debugging in Developer Options
(optionally) check on the type of USB connection, MTP or PTP should work
(Optionally) Because I did it, also do a revoke USB tap.
